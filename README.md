# Mobelux Coding Challenge

## Objective

Create a photo album sharing site with support for multiple users

### Web Application Requirements

#### Create Views and backend logic:

* Users should be able to log in (User sign up and password reset is not necessary. Users can be created via the Django admin)
* Using a custom form (not the Django Admin), users should be able to create an album with a name. Albums can be either public or private. 
* Users should be able to upload images to an album. Images should have a title associated with them.
* For the public-facing part of the site, there should be a list of albums for a user and for each album a simple list of photos.

### Web API Requirements

#### Create the RESTful API endpoints:

* Get a list of albums for a user
* Get a list of photos for an album.


### Technical Details

Language/Framework: Python/Django

Min Version: Django 2.2+

Database: Your choice


### Misc

The UI should be very simple, don’t spend much time on making it look great. We’re looking for software development best practices and architecture. Imagine this app at a larger scale. How should it be built to easily add features and more views?

Please use Git to track your work. When delivering code, either send a link to the hosted repo or zip the project folder, including the Git history, and email the zip to me.

Please ask any questions that may be helpful in completing this challenge.
